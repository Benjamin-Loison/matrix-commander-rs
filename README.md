# matrix-commander-rs
simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending, receiving, and much more

# Help create this Rust program

This Rust project is currently bare essentials. 
A more feature-rich Python package `matrix-commander`
exists. See [matrix-commander](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/).
The vision is to have a compatible program in Rust.
This project depends on you. The project will only advance if you provide
some code. Have a look at the repo
[matrix-commander-rs](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander-rs/).
Please help! :pray: Please contribute code to enhance this
[matrix-commander](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-commander) crate.
Safe!

:heart: :clap: :pray:

  see the project. Do it now, thanks. :clap:
- Talk about it to your friends, post it in chatrooms, Hacker News, etc.
  This will give exposure and help find people willing to provide code,
  contributions, and PRs.
- Write code yourself. :rocket: Features that you might want to code: 
  - implement `login` via SSO
  - add --proxy (see Python documentation)
  - add --nossl (see Python documentation)
